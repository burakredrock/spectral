    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 02, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Spectra</strong> ("we", "us", or "the App") collects, uses, and discloses your information. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>A. Face Data & Images</h3>
    <p>To provide our core features (Face Analysis, Color Analysis, and Style Recommendations), you must upload an image of your face. 
    <br><strong>Important:</strong> We do not sell your face data to third parties. We do not use your photos to train public AI models without your consent.</p>

    <h3>B. Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We collect anonymous data about how you use the app (e.g., buttons clicked, time spent) to improve the user experience. We also collect device information such as your device model, OS version, and region (Locale) to provide the correct language and shopping links.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data (AI Processing)</h2>
    <p>The photos you upload are processed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Images are sent specifically to our cloud providers (Google Firebase and Google Gemini API) solely for the purpose of analyzing facial features and generating the report.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Images are stored in your private, secure cloud database so you can view your history. You can delete these images at any time within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> We use artificial intelligence to determine attributes like face shape, skin undertone, and aesthetic archetypes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may employ third-party companies due to the following reasons: to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> For authentication, database storage, and hosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Gemini AI:</strong> For processing image analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>RevenueCat / Apple In-App Purchase:</strong> For processing subscription payments. We do not store your credit card information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Affiliate Links & External Sites</h2>

Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your data. You can delete your account and all associated data directly within the app settings or by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.</p>
