    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 02, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Spectra</strong>. By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.</p>

    <h2>1. The Services</h2>
    <p>Spectra is an AI-powered application that provides aesthetic analysis, color analysis, and style recommendations ("The Service"). The app uses artificial intelligence to analyze user-uploaded photos.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The analysis provided by Spectra (including "Forensic Analysis", "Aura Score", and medical-sounding terms) is for <strong>entertainment and lifestyle purposes only</strong>. It should not be considered as professional medical, dermatological, or psychological advice.</p>

    <h2>2. User Content & AI Processing</h2>
    <p>To use the Service, you must upload images of your face or outfits. By uploading content, you grant Spectra a temporary license to process this image via our AI providers (e.g., Google Gemini, Firebase) solely for the purpose of generating your analysis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You affirm that you own the rights to the photos you upload.</li>
        <li>We do not sell your biometric data to third parties.</li>
        <li>Images are processed to generate the report and are handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>Spectra offers a "Premium" subscription that unlocks detailed reports and unlimited scans.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Payments are processed through the Apple App Store (iTunes Account).</li>
        <li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID Account Settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Links & Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., Amazon, Google Shopping) that are not owned or controlled by Spectra.</p>
    <p>Spectra may participate in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn a commission on purchases made through our links to third-party sites. This does not affect the price you pay.</p>
    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upload content that is illegal, offensive, or violates the rights of others.</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse engineer the AI models or the app's code.</li>
        <li>Use the analysis to harass, bully, or discriminate against others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Spectra is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the AI analysis will be 100% accurate, error-free, or meet your expectations. The developers of Spectra shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
